#Project Description â€“ LDR & IR Controlled LED System (ESP-IDF v5.4.1, ESP32-S3)

This project implements a simple light control system on the ESP32-S3 using ESP-IDF v5.4.1, combining input from an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) and an IR (Infrared) sensor to control an LED.

The IR sensor acts as a toggle switch: each time motion or obstruction is detected, it enables or disables the LDR-based control logic.

When LDR control is active, the system continuously monitors ambient light:

ðŸŒ‘ Dark environment â†’ LED remains OFF

ðŸ’¡ Bright environment â†’ LED turns ON

If the IR sensor disables LDR mode, the LED is forced OFF, regardless of light conditions.

The project demonstrates:

Use of GPIO inputs and outputs in ESP-IDF

Real-time sensor polling with FreeRTOS tasks

Simple state toggling and debouncing logic

Use of ESP_LOGI for serial debug logging

Pin configuration (default):

GPIO12 â€“ LDR sensor input

GPIO5 â€“ IR sensor input

GPIO2 â€“ LED output

This project is ideal as a starting point for smart lighting systems, sensor fusion demos, or embedded automation projects on ESP32-S3.
